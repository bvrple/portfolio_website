    <p class="synopsis">
      Having always had a periphery interest in tech I decided during the latter
      stages of 2020 to finally take the plunge and begin teaching myself to
      code, beginning with a Python course on Udemy and later supplementing that
      information with YouTube tutorials.
    </p>

    <p class="synopsis">
      In 2021 I was lucky enough to be offered an opportunity with QA Ltd in
      which I underwent a 3 month training program where I learned about agile
      principles and DevOps methodologies. During this time my interest in IT
      continued to grow as I became exposed to a variety interesting languages,
      frameworks, DevOps tools, and cloud platforms.
    </p>

    <p class="synopsis">
      Since completing this training I have continued to study on my own and am
      committed to the continued task of self-improvement, and with a naturally
      inquisitive attitude, I find great solice in knowing that there is always
      more to learn, and that the pursuit of knowledge in this field never ends.
